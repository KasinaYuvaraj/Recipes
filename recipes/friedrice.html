        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This egg fried rice recipe is designed to work with any cooking setup, whether you're lucky enough <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/perfect-egg-fried-rice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">...</a></p>
        <p>Let's talk about egg fried rice. Egg fried rice in its absolute purest form—nothing but eggs, rice, cooking oil, soy sauce, and scallions—is one of the simplest stir-fries around. But like all simple foods—pizza, grilled cheese,
             a roasted chicken—it's the details of the process that elevate its basic ingredients into something transcendental.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable or other neutral oil</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, thoroughly beaten</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups (about 1 pound/450g) cooked rice (see note)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons (10ml) light soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 scallions, thinly sliced crosswise</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b>To cook in a wok on a gas burner:</b>Preheat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat. If cooking on a powerful outdoor wok burner, reduce heat to minimum. If using a standard Western burner, keep heat on high throughout cooking. Add eggs to center of wok and cook, 
                swirling wok until eggs are puffy and lightly browned on the bottom, about 10 seconds on a powerful burner or 30 seconds on a standard burner.
                 Flip eggs and lightly brown on second side.
                 Push eggs up to the side of the wok.</li>
                 <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok and swirl to coat. Add rice to center of wok. Flip eggs on top of rice, then using a wok spatula, break the rice and eggs up, tossing and stirring as you break them. Stir-fry until rice starts to pop and jump on its own when you set the wok down,
                     about 1 minute on a powerful burner or 2 to 3 minutes on a standard burner.</li>
                <li>Add remaining tablespoon of oil around the rim of the wok, then add the soy sauce to the same spot. Stir-fry until rice and eggs are evenly coated in the soy sauce
                     (the rice should be more or less broken up into distinct grains without any large clumps).
                     Add scallions. Remove from heat and toss to combine.
                     Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.</li>
                <li><b>To cook in a skillet on an electric or induction burner:</b>Add 1 tablespoon oil to a large non-stick, carbon steel, or cast iron skillet and swirl to coat. Heat over high heat until oil is shimmering. Add eggs to center of pan and cook without moving until puffed and lightly browned on one side, about 30 seconds.
                     Fold eggs into a loose omelet and push to the side of the pan.</li>
                <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pan and swirl to coat. Add rice to center of pan. Flip eggs on top of rice, then using a wooden spoon, break the rice and eggs up, tossing and stirring as you break them.
                     Stir-fry until rice grains are loose and separated, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add soy sauce to the pan. Stir-fry until rice and eggs are evenly coated in the soy sauce (the rice should be more or less broken up into distinct grains without any large clumps). Add scallions. 
                    Remove from heat and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.</li>
