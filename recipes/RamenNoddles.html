            Add the chicken stock and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a small pot of water to boil. Lower the eggs with a spoon and simmer them for 7 minutes if you want a soft and runny centre and 9-10 minutes if you want hard-boiled eggs.
             Once done, transfer the eggs to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. Set them aside.</li>
        <li>Take the same pot and bring the water to boil again. 
            Then add the noodles and cook them for 3 minutes or as per the directions on the package. Sieve and keep them aside.</li>
        <li>Take a bowl and add the noodles to it. Then add the broth and the shredded chicken. Remove the eggs from the cold water. Peel the shell and cut the egg in half. 
            Pout ½ teaspoon of soy sauce, sriracha sauce and garnish with fresh cilantro. Chicken Ramen is ready to serve.</li>
