    <o>
        <li><b>Wash the chicken and prepare the marinade</b>
            <p>To make this delicious recipe, begin with washing the chicken in some lukewarm water and rinse it again in cold water. Then take a large bowl and combine chicken, eggs, ginger-garlic paste and cornflour in it. Mix all the ingredients properly. 
                You can also drizzle a little water to the batter to coat the chicken pieces evenly. 
                Once done, refrigerate the chicken for 1-2 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Prepare the chilli chicken masala</b>
            <p>After 1-2 hours, take out the marinade. Next, heat oil in a deep pan over a high flame. Carefully place the chicken pieces in the oil until cooked through. Remove and drain excess oil on absorbent paper. Meanwhile, heat 1 or 2 tbsps of oil in a separate pan over medium flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, add the onions and fry for 2-3 minutes till they turn translucent. Then add the capsicum and green chillies and mix well again. 
                You can also add some dry roasted green chillies to accentuate the taste.
                 Moreover, If you prefer the dish extra spicy, you can also add some vinegar-soaked green chillies to this recipe, as it adds to the taste and flavour. (optional)</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cook chicken in soy sauce & vinegar</b>
            <p>When the veggies are partially cooked, add soy sauce, vinegar, chicken and salt. 
                Mix all the ingredients well and make sure that the chicken is well coated in the sauces. 
                Keep stirring so that the chicken does not stick to the pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Toss the Chilli Chicken and serve hot</b>
            <p>Once done, remove and transfer the dish to a bowl. Garnish with the spring onions and roasted sesame seeds (optional) and serve it to your family and friends.
